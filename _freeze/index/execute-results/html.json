The repository is organized as an R Package.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo start with the course you can download or clone the entire Git repository. Simply run `git clone link` or follow this link.\n\nThen you can open the `GLMphd.Rproj` file and R Studio will be opened on the correct folder. From now, everything is organized as a package. To load all the custom function of the `R` folder and datasets (`data` folder) you can use `devtools::load_all()`. This is the same as doing `source(\"file.R\")` without cluttering the global environment.\n\n# Schedule\n\n|     Day    |     Hour    | Room |    Course    |\n|:----------:|:-----------:|:----:|:------------:|\n| 20-11-2023 | 09:00-12:00 |  4T  | GLM - Part A |\n| 21-11-2023 | 09:00-11:00 |  4T  | GLM - Part A |\n| 27-11-2023 | 14:30-17:30 |  4M  | GLM - Part A |\n| 28-11-2023 | 14:30-16:30 |  4N  | GLM - Part A |\n| 04-12-2023 | 09:00-12:00 |  4T  | GLM - Part B |\n| 05-12-2023 | 09:00-11:00 |  4T  | GLM - Part B |\n\n",
